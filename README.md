Chrome Extension that restructures the Piazza forum UI

## What
I've increasingly heard complaints about the subpar quality of the Piazza forum that's popularly used by university courses around the world.

`calzone` is a Chrome Extension that redoes the Piazza forum user interface from scratch, making your content more readable and enjoyable. The point is to make Piazza not look like it's a college kid's failed side-project from the early 2000s.

## The Name
A Calzone is an Italian dish that's basically a folded Pizza; it's almost like a turnover. It's essentially a restructured Pizza. Likewise, `calzone` restructures *Piazza*, more specially, it's UI, to make it look good. Clever, right?

> It sounded better in my head.
